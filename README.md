## What is Stackmate.io
[Stackmate.io](https://stackmate.io) is an open source project that aims to make infrastructure as code easy and accessible to everyone. By using a very simple YAML file, you can generate your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration and deploy it automatically.

## Why Stackmate.io

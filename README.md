## Geting started
Follow [this]([https://docs.stackmate.io/guides/quick-start](https://docs.stackmate.io/guides/getting-started)) simple and comprehensive "[getting started](https://docs.stackmate.io/guides/getting-started)" guide to deploy yout first project with Stackmate

## What is Stackmate?
[Stackmate](https://stackmate.io) is a free, opinionated, open source tool that helps busy professionals deploy their cloud infrastructure without doing much. It abstracts and simplifies resource creation, modification and destruction in an intuitive way.
The reasoning behind Stackmate is that most of the times, all developers want is to simply deploy their database, cache or object storage services, without having to read the manual or go through complex DevOps processes.

## Who is Stackmate for?
Stackmate was built with the busy developer in mind. It's for people who want to deploy an average traffic website, that depends on a database and a few complementary services, without spending a lifetime in complex consoles or developer tools.

## How it works
Stackmate uses an extremely simple configuration file either in JSON or YAML format (yes, we hear ya). After that's done, you can use `stackmate deploy <environment` to deploy your infrastructure on the provider of your choice.
Alternatively, you can use our [Cloud](https://stackmate.io/cloud/) version that abstracts even more details away from you.
